# DESMO-LD Contracts

**Overview** 

The Desmo-LD iExecDOracle is a Smart contract that implements the IExec INTERFACE_NAME. Its purpose is to serve as the main API entrypoint for client Smart Contracts. Additionally, to the IExec API, the DESMO-LD iExecDOracle will implement the logic to randomly select a set of valid Thing Description Directories registered in the DESMO-LD Hub. The APIs will serve on-chain clients with endpoints that can search for a device inside the DESMO-LD network of Thing Description Directories, get sensor data, invoke operations on remote sensors and finally subscribe to events.
