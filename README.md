# DESMO-LD Contracts

**Overview** 

> Desmo is a Smart contract that implements the IExec `IexecDoracle`. Its purpose is to serve as the main API entrypoint for DESMO-LD client Smart Contracts. Additionally, Desmo will implement the logic to randomly select a set of valid Thing Description Directories registered in the DESMOHub. The APIs will serve on-chain clients with endpoints that can search for a device inside the DESMO-LD network of Thing Description Directories, get sensor data and invoke operations on remote sensors.
